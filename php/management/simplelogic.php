	<h2>Some simple logic</h2>

	<p>
				Some simple logic that is causing me to furrow my brow. Please,
				if you can refute one of my premises or dispute any of my
				conclusions then let me know.</p><p>Thinking about Microsoft
				Windows, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office:</p>
				<p>(1) Security vulnerabilities continue to be found in these
				products today</p>
				<p>(2) Forthcoming releases of these products are subject to the
				same patches as the current releases</p>
				<p>THEREFORE (1+2)</p>
				<p>(A) Unpatched vulnerabilities still exist in current and
				future versions of these products.</p>
				<p>Now,</p>
				<p>(3) Security patches, virus checkers and firewalls protect
				against known vulnerabilities</p>
				<p>THEREFORE (A+3)</p>
				<p>(B) We have no protection against an exploit of an unpatched
				vulnerability.</p>
				<p>Furthermore,</p>
				<p>(4) Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office have around 100%
				market share on the corporate desktop</p>
				<p>(5) Many people and organizations have a financial or
				political interest in attacking or threatening to attack wealthy
				corporations.</p>
				<p>(6) Some of these organizations have substantial resources to
				mount a sophisticated attack</p>
				<p>THEREFORE (B+4+5+6)</p>
				<p>(C) There are organizations planning to attack the corporate
				desktop using an unpatched vulnerability for financial or
				political gain.</p>
				<p>(D) <strong>There is considerable risk of a severely damaging attack</strong></p>
				<p>What is perplexing me is the unwillingness of any corporation
				I know to do something about this. I am talking about an attack
				that could threaten the viability of a major global corporation.
				Top headline on the evening news. Pundits talking domesday
				scenarios.</p>
				<p>Some organizations have publicly announced moves to an open
				source desktop platform (Telstra, City of Munich etc.) but this
				has always been for cost reasons.</p>
				<p>Why isnâ€™t this the most talked about issue in IT? The only
				reason I can think of is the analogy with climate change:</p>
				<p>(a) the threat increases slowly, and there is no natural
				trigger for action<br>
				(b) the cost of mitigating the threat is substantial<br>
				(c) the mitigation is not guaranteed to work<br>
				(d) the cost is incurred today and the benefit is gained
				tomorrow or the day after<br>
				(e) it is boring</p>
